const accountId = 1234; //couldn't modify there value
let name = "deepak"; //modify there value
var surname = "kumar"; //var keyboard doesn't used now,past time problem so this keyword used for scope inside

javascript = "language"; //some time you don't give keyword it able to handle but it is wrong practice and uses

// accountId = 54;
// console.log(accountId);  //not work after printout

//let examine other variable keyword
name="deep";
surname="mehta";
javascript="powerful"
let go; //if you doesn't pass anything it will give result undefined
console.table([name,surname,javascript,go]);

//above all variable modified
